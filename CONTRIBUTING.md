## Git Flow

This project follows the [Git Flow](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/) 
branching workflow for managing features, hotfixes and releases.

Please have a read first of Jeff Kreeftmeijer 
[blog post](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/) which does a great job of 
describing it.

After cloning the repo locally, create a new feature branch:

```
git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-feature develop
```

When ready push your changes from this branch to remove (Github) and create a 
new pull request against the **develop** branch.
